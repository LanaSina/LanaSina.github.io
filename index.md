## Who am I?

I am a founding member of Sony Computer Science Lab's new [Kyoto lab](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/kyoto/). Read more about my motivation for starting the lab at that link. I research learning and predictive systems, and I am interested in sanitizing science practices.
You can read about my career path on my [CV](lana_cv.pdf).

## What am I working on?

Currently I am researching [visual illusions in neural networks](https://github.com/LanaSina/evolutionary_illusion_generator), biological and artificial, on the principle that systems that "fail" as the brain does teach us more than systems that superficially succeed as humans do. I am not so much interested in perfect artificial vision as I am interested in charmingly and accurately faulty artficial perception.

I also work on measures of complexity and measures of "life". How could you detect life on [faraway planets](https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Paper/480711)? What kind of data and how much of it do you need to make a reasonable assumption about [whether a system is alive or not](https://github.com/LanaSina/FLR_contest)?

Other projects of mine include putting predictive networks in mobile phones, building platforms for collaborative open science, and recording weird behavior in plants.
