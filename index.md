Artficial Life - Open Science - Artificial Intelligence

## Who am I?

I research learning, predictive systems, and [Artificial Perception](https://sites.google.com/view/artificialperception/home) and I am interested in sanitizing science practices (read about Mimosa Open Collaboration [here](https://openmimosablog.wordpress.com/)!).
I am an associate researcher (and founding member) of Sony Computer Science Labs' new [Kyoto Lab](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/kyoto/). I am also the Research Chair of the [International Society for ALife's](http://www.alife.org/about-isal) board of directors, a member of ISAL's DEI committee, an associate editor of the Journal of Artificial Life, and a member of eLife (not related to ALife!) [Early Career Advisory Group](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/be26bd40/early-career-advisory-group-election-results-2021).
You can read about my career path on my [CV](lana_cv.pdf) (tl;dr: I went to Engineering School in France then moved to Japan where I got my Master's and PhD. I used to speak ~9 languages and can do just about anything that involves programming. Sometimes I get awards for scientific work or non scientific work. My favorite scientist is [Frans De Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal). I like food.)

## Read me 

I wrote about changing science publishing through the collaborative open science platform I am developing: https://openmimosablog.wordpress.com/

Learn about Artificial Life in my [Introduction to Artificial Life for People who Like AI](https://thegradient.pub/an-introduction-to-artificial-life-for-people-who-like-ai/) on The Gradient.

I write about my ideas and curate exciting science on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sina_lana)

This [very old blog](https://itakoyak.wordpress.com/) has scientific ideas as well as more personal stories.

Most of my papers are listed in my Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?hl=en&pli=1&user=UVvjeaoAAAAJ)

## What am I working on?

I am interested in systems that learn in unconventional ways, as well as unconventional systems that learn in mainstream ways. Currently I work a lot on predictive coding. Some of my projects:

I research [visual illusions in neural networks](https://github.com/LanaSina/evolutionary_illusion_generator), biological and artificial, on the principle that systems that "fail" as the brain does teach us more than systems that superficially succeed as humans do. I am not so much interested in perfect artificial vision as I am interested in charmingly and accurately faulty artficial perception.

I also work on measures of complexity and measures of "life". How could you detect life on [faraway planets](https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Paper/480711)? What kind of data and how much of it do you need to make a reasonable assumption about [whether a system is alive or not](https://github.com/LanaSina/FLR_contest)?

I am building a platform for [better science](https://openmimosablog.wordpress.com/).

Other projects of mine include putting predictive networks in mobile phones and recording weird behavior in plants.
