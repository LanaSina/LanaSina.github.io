## About

Artficial Life - Artificial Intelligence - Open Science

These days I am especially interested in replicating evolution (of biological or cultural systems), looking for life in the universe, and supporting local traditions using tech. I am still working on ways to improve open science sharing/publishing/open collaboration. [My dog talks](https://www.instagram.com/iikocookie/).

## What am I working on?

### Agnostic biosignatures
How do we look for life in the universe when we don't know what that life will look like? One approach is to focus on what life does rather than what it is made of.

Life makes planetary surfaces more complex: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03699

Life replicates, mutates, and leaves unique correlations behind: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195

### Self-replication and Exponential Mutation in Neural Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are these litte programs that look like moving patterns on a grid. Recently, several advances have brought those automata from the famous black and white grids to full on interactive, sometimes continuous graphics.
I [wrote](https://www.qeios.com/read/JPUWVB) about making the patterns self-replicate and trying to make them gain more diverse mutations.

### Artificial Perception
I research [visual illusions in neural networks](https://github.com/LanaSina/evolutionary_illusion_generator), biological and artificial, on the principle that systems that "fail" as the brain does teach us more than systems that superficially succeed as humans do. I am not so much interested in perfect artificial vision as I am interested in charmingly and accurately faulty artficial perception.

### Astrobiology: looking for life in the universe

I work on measures of complexity and measures of "life". How could you detect life on [faraway planets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01559-x) (arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03699)? What kind of data and how much of it do you need to make a reasonable assumption about [whether a system is alive or not](https://github.com/LanaSina/FLR_contest)?

### Innovative Science Publishing

I am building a platform for [better science](https://openmimosablog.wordpress.com/).

Lately I have been thinking of pivoting to content augmentation based on fediverse posts (https://lanasina.github.io/FederatedMimosa/) and playing with Myst formatting ([demo below](https://lanasina.github.io/mystmosa/paper)).

## Who am I?

I am a French researcher living in Kyoto with my dog.
I research the principles of the evoluton of life, learning, predictive systems, and [Artificial Perception](https://sites.google.com/view/artificialperception/home). I give talks on Artificial Life, Open Ended Evolution, Purposeful Failure, and Predictive Coding.

I am interested in changing science culture and sanitizing science practices (read about Mimosa Open Collaboration [here](https://openmimosablog.wordpress.com/), and contact me to access the beta). Find my Artificial Life talks [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYuu1RcSnrYRS5HJNivMQDvaQQq0E7J5G), for general audiences or more specific communities.

I am an associate researcher (and founding member) of Sony Computer Science Labs' new [Kyoto Lab](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/kyoto/) and an associate professor at the [National Institute for Basic Biology](http://www.nibb.ac.jp/en/) in Japan.
I am also the Research Chair of the [International Society for ALife's](http://www.alife.org/about-isal) board of directors, a member of ISAL's DEI committee, and a member of eLife (not related to ALife!) [Early Career Advisory Group](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/be26bd40/early-career-advisory-group-election-results-2021).

You can read about my career path on my [CV (2023)](lana_cv.pdf) (tl;dr: I went to Engineering School in France then moved to Japan where I got my Master's and PhD. I used to speak ~9 languages and can do just about anything that involves programming. Sometimes I get awards for scientific work or non scientific work. My favorite scientist is [Frans De Waal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal). I like food.)
